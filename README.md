## 📋 Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing a detailed dataset from **FedEx Logistics**, which operates a complex global supply chain. The dataset includes information about:

- Purchase Orders  
- Shipping Methods  
- Vendor Agreements  
- Delivery Schedules  
- Product Details

The goal is to **uncover inefficiencies**, identify **bottlenecks or delays**, and evaluate **cost-efficiency** in the logistics process. With global eCommerce booming, optimizing logistics and improving delivery performance is vital.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main problem statement is:
> To identify key factors contributing to inefficiencies in FedEx's global supply chain—especially shipment delays, inconsistent delivery performance, and high shipping/insurance costs.
